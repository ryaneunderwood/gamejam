Worm-Game was developed by Lucas Bezerra, Eleanor Fascione, Ashley Li, Emanuele Michielin, Aditi Pradeep, and Ryan Underwood in November 2022

The goal is to get from a starting word to an ending word by either adding, removing, or changing one letter at a time, keeping all intermediate words valid english words.

The dictionary used is based on the Scrabble Dictionary

The game has three modes:
Daily: A single curated word pair is given every day
Challenge: Unlimited randomly selected words
Free play: User picks start and end words
